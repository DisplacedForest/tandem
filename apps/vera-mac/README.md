# Vera (macOS app)

Native SwiftUI client for Vera. Text chat streams directly from a configured OpenAI-compatible
`/v1` endpoint and stores conversations in `~/.vera/vera.sqlite`. Pulse, Memory,
and the Agentic canvas remain optional surfaces backed by vera-api. Veins are managed from
the Pulse header; the Plugins manager lives in Settings.

## Develop
```bash
swift run                       # dev build + launch
swift build                     # compile check
.build/debug/Vera --selftest    # headless: native transport, persistence, importers, stores
.build/debug/Vera --shot out.png --view chat|pulse|memory|agentic|veins|settings-plugins|settings|settings-advanced|onboarding   # render a screenshot
.build/debug/Vera --dump-context   # print the assembled per-request system context, section by section
```
Config lives in `~/.vera/config.json`, editable in-app via Settings (⌘,): `model_base`,
`model_api_key`, `model`, `voice_base`, `vera_api_base`, and `owner_name`. The model base must
end in `/v1`; its key is optional. `VERA_MODEL_BASE`, `VERA_MODEL_API_KEY`, and `VERA_MODEL`
override file values. First launch with no native model config opens onboarding. The app is
standalone: chat, history, memory, and tools need only the model endpoint, and every other
surface degrades cleanly when its optional service is unset. The one legacy exception is the
voice session, which still streams through an Open WebUI socket until voice moves onto the
native engine; its connection settings live entirely inside that quarantined module.

Chat history starts fresh on a native install by design; prior Open WebUI conversations are
not imported. Knowledge collections are the one dataset carried over, migrated server-side
into the vera-api document store (see `docs/SETUP.md`). Pulse keeps working whenever the
optional vera-api URL is configured, and Continue in chat lands the card in the local
database as a native conversation: text, citations, and provenance persist locally and
reopen offline, while remote card images stay uncached and use the normal failure
placeholders if their source goes away.

Native tools live in Settings, Tools and are disabled by default. Apple Reminders runs
locally after macOS permission. Web search and deep research call the configured vera-api
(`vera_api_base`); with no vera-api URL set they are unavailable and their rows show the
unconfigured hint. Deep research runs on its own 300-second deadline, and its report renders
with citation chips and a numbered sources row that persist with the conversation.

Advanced model controls (Settings, Model, Advanced) tune per-model request parameters:
sampling, tokens and stops, reasoning, streaming, a context-length ceiling, and custom
chat-template-kwargs entries. Overrides are stored per endpoint profile and model in
`native_chat.parameterOverrides`; unset controls are omitted from the payload, capability
gating follows the model's profile (including the reasoning flag), and
`VERA_CHAT_TEMPLATE_KWARGS` still replaces the kwargs object wholesale when set. The
section's Last request panel shows the resolved parameter set for the most recent send.

Config-driven tools extend the same registry. A JSON declaration dropped in
`~/.vera/tools.d/` loads at startup and again on every Settings save, and a valid one joins
the built-ins in Settings, Tools, the tool-calling loop, and the confirmation path exactly
like a native tool defined in code.

`NativeContextAssembler` builds each request's system context deterministically, in a fixed
order: app policy, the active persona, user context, per-conversation instructions, session
facts (date, time, owner name), recalled memory, a world-model seam, and capability context (per-tool usage contracts plus the ask,
artifact, chart, and citation format contracts, injected only when the model and
configuration support them; citations join only when a research-capable tool is active). Every section has a character cap, identical inputs assemble byte-identical context,
and `--dump-context` shows exactly what a request would contain.

The prompt library (Settings, Persona) manages that user-authored text in the local
database: personas with one active selection, user-context profiles, and reusable prompts
inserted into the composer as message text. Every save keeps a revision snapshot with exact
restore, entries import and export as markdown with a small front-matter header, and
validation rejects oversize content, credential-shaped text, and anything claiming the
policy scope. The legacy single system prompt migrates in as the default persona on first
launch. Per-conversation instructions live on the conversation row and are edited from a
chip above the composer.

## Package & install

Packaging requires Python 3.14 or later on the build machine. `package.sh` bundles an arm64 Python 3.12 runtime, Node 22 and the pinned Pi 1.0.4 SDK, so the packaged Pi experiment does not need a checkout or developer tools on its destination Mac. This app requires macOS 26 or later. Normal launch still opens the existing native app; bundling the runtime does not enable a live Pi assistant automatically.

Runtime inputs are pinned in `runtime/runtime-lock.json` and the Pi npm lock. Assembly verifies every download and never executes package installation scripts. `VERA_RUNTIME_CACHE` chooses the download cache; `VERA_RUNTIME_OFFLINE=1` requires all pinned inputs already present. The bundle includes dependency notices and a complete inventory whose digest is compiled into the executable. Startup checks this seal and every runtime file before execution. Developer-path overrides remain available only as a complete `--repo`, `--python`, `--node` set; ordinary development builds cannot implicitly load a bundled runtime.

The packaged headless fixture uses a fresh explicit data directory and injected credentials and model responses:

```sh
build/Tandem.app/Contents/MacOS/Vera --pi-candidate-contract --root /tmp/vera-packaged-fixture
```

For checkout-denied cancellation, real process-kill recovery and integrity checks, copy the package outside the checkout and run the portable contract from the repository with the development Python environment:

```sh
python3 scripts/tests/packaged_runtime_contract.py --app /tmp/vera-portable/Tandem.app --output-dir /tmp/vera-portable/evidence
```

These are offline fixture checks. Clean-user onboarding, real provider access, signing distribution policy and target-device validation remain separate requirements. User settings, conversations and credentials are never package inputs.

```bash
scripts/package.sh              # -> build/Tandem.app (ad-hoc signed)
scripts/deploy.sh               # package + install to /Applications (+ a second Mac if configured)
VERA_STUDIO_HOST=user@my-other-mac scripts/deploy.sh    # also push to a second Mac
```
Bump `VERSION` for a new release version (the build number is the git short sha).

### First launch (ad-hoc signed)
The app is **ad-hoc signed** (no Developer ID), so Gatekeeper will block a double-click
on a fresh copy. `deploy.sh` clears the quarantine attribute on install. If you ever
copy it manually, either right-click → **Open** once, or:
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Tandem.app
```
`spctl --assess` will report it as rejected: expected for ad-hoc; it still runs.


## Persistent assistant experiment

The Pi experiment uses the existing native window, sidebar, transcript, composer and task cards. The Vera destination is separate from focused chats created with New chat. Assistant messages and pending requests stay in the isolated Pi session journal; they are not inserted into focused-chat history or submitted to its turn scheduler. Leaving Vera keeps its background tasks running.

Normal launch preserves the existing configuration and shows the assistant as disconnected until an app-owned session is supplied. There is no automatic test runtime or cloud connection. The old standalone prototype shell is not the native app frontend.

`--pi-native-contract` exercises the native presentation adapter headlessly with the app-owned mock provider. Supply the same explicit `--root`, `--repo`, `--python`, `--node` and `--port` arguments as the Pi candidate contract. `--pi-native-reopen-contract` verifies the saved session after that process exits. These contracts make no real credential or model calls.

The explicitly requested `--pi-candidate-mock` visual fixture now enters through `VeraApp` and `ContentView`. It requires `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` to point to a separate disposable home, and both `--root` and any `VERA_CONFIG_DIR` override must stay inside that home. Its focused chats have separate local history and no model connection. Native assistant attachments and ratings remain unavailable; classic chat retains its existing controls. Output buttons reveal validated workspace files in Finder.

Task approval uses the exact decision displayed. Recovery first refreshes the original reply and tasks; Continue without reply archives that request without resending or stopping its work. A changed draft is preserved. No visual acceptance or live cloud-model result is implied by the headless contracts.
