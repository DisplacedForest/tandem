"""Plain-English run-detail summaries. Standalone — run: pytest tests/test_scheduler_summary.py

A scheduler run's recorded detail must read as one or two human sentences with the
headline numbers, never a serialized run record. These cover the named job kinds
(pulse, signals, updates) plus the gated and fallback paths, and assert
that no output carries dict/repr markers.
